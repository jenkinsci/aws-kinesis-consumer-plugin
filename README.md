This plugin provides an interface to listen application records coming from
Kinesis.

To implement listener in your plugin, the below dependencies need to be added in
your pom.xml:

```xml
<project>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jenkins-ci.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-kinesis-consumer</artifactId>
      <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

</project>
```
